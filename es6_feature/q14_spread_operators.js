// Q: 14
// Title:
// L1 - Merging and Updating Nested Objects with Spread Operator

// Problem Statement:
// You are given two nested objects: profile and updates. Your task is to merge the two objects using the spread operator, ensuring that specific nested properties in updates overwrite those in profile.

// Steps:
// Create two objects:
// profile: contains name, age, address (which is an object with properties like city and zipcode).
// updates: contains updated age, and an updated address object with a new zipcode and added country property.
// Merge the objects using the spread operator, ensuring the updated properties from updates overwrite the existing ones.
// Return the new merged object.
// Example Input

// const profile = { name: "Charlie", age: 29, address: { city: "San Francisco", zipcode: "94101" } };

// const updates = { age: 30, address: { zipcode: "94109", country: "USA" } };

// Example Output:

// { name: "Charlie", age: 30, address: { city: "San Francisco", zipcode: "94109", country: "USA" } }


const profile = {
    name: "Charlie",
    age: 29,
    address: { city: "San Francisco", zipcode: "94101" }
  };
  
  const updates = {
    age: 30,
    address: { zipcode: "94109", country: "USA" }
  };
  
  // Merge the objects
  const mergedProfile = {
    ...profile,
    ...updates,
    address: {
      ...profile.address,
      ...updates.address
    }
  };
  
  console.log(mergedProfile);
